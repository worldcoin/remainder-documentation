# Gate Frontend Tutorial
We build off of the theory introduction to "gate layers" in GKR, in the [Canonic GKR](../gkr_tutorial/canonic_gkr.md) section. The following section shows examples on how to create these layers, defined by wirings and the binary operation they denote, in Remainder.

## Example 1: $\text{add}$ Gate

### Diagram
Let us define the following layerwise relationship, as a small GKR circuit:

### Code
The way we would represent the above diagram as a GKR circuit in Remainder is:

## Exmpale 2: $\text{mul}$ Gate

### Diagram
Let us define the following layerwise relationship, as a small GKR circuit:

### Code
The way we would represent the above diagram as a GKR circuit in Remainder is:

## Example 3: $\text{identity}$ Gate

### Diagram
Let us define the following layerwise relationship, as a small GKR circuit:

### Code
The way we would represent the above diagram as a GKR circuit in Remainder is:
